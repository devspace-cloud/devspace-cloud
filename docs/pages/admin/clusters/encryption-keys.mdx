When connecting a cluster to DevSpace Cloud, the CLI asks you to provide an encryption key. DevSpace uses this key to encrypt the access to your Kubernetes cluster and send the encrypted access token to DevSpace Cloud. That means that DevSpace Cloud can only access your cluster when you provide the encryption key. 

:::note 
The CLI securely stores your encryption key on your local machine and only sends it to DevSpace Cloud when running operations where DevSpace Cloud needs cluster access, e.g. when creating Spaces.

## Reset Keys
There are two methods how you can reset your cluster key, if you or another cluster user has forgotten his cluster key:

<Tabs
  defaultValue="user"
  values={[
    { label: 'Cluster User', value: 'user', },
    { label: 'Cluster Admin', value: 'admin', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="user">

1. Generate a new invite link via the UI.
2. Send invite link to the user.

:::warning
Please be aware that you cannot reinvite yourself to a cluster
:::

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="admin">

If you are a cluster admin, run:
```bash
devspace reset key [cluster-name]
```

Then, select the admin kube-context of the cluster that you want to reset the key for.

</TabItem>
</Tabs>
